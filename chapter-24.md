## Chapter 24: Maximizing Software Engineering Methods

### Agile

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

### Scrum

Scrum is an iterative process. In Scrum, each iteration is called a _sprint cycle_. At the end of each sprint, the goal is to have a version of the software available that is fully working and tested, and which represents a subset of the customers' requirements. 

Roles

There are three roles in Scrum. The first role, Product Owner (PO), is the connection to the customer and to other people. The PO writes high-level user stories based on input from the customer, gives each user story a priority, and puts the stories in the Scrum product backlog. 

The second role, Scrum Master (SM), is responsible for keeping the process running and can be part of the team, although not the team leader, because with Scrum the team leads itself. The SM is the contact person for the team so that the rest of the team members can concentrate on their tasks. The SM ensures that the Scrum process is followed correctly by the team, for example, by organizing the Daily Scrum meetings. 

The Scrum process enforces a daily meeting called the Daily Scrum or Standup. During this meeting, all team members get to answer three questions:

- what did you do since the last daily scrum
- what are you planning to do
- what problems are you facing?

Problems faced by the team members should be noted by the Scrum Master, who will try to solve them after the Daily Scrum meeting.

Before the start of each sprint cycle, there is a sprint planning meeting in which team members must decide which product features they will implement in the new sprint. This is formalized in a sprint backlog.

In a Scrum team you will sometimes find a physical board with three colums: To Do, In Progress and Done. 

A final step in the Scrum process is a demo. At the end of each sprint cycle, a demo should be given to show the sprint results to all interested stakeholders.
